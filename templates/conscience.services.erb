# Service pools declarations
# ----------------------------
#
# Pools are automatically created if not defined in configuration,
# according to storage policy or service update policy rules.
#
# "targets" is a ';'-separated list.
# Each target is a ','-separated list of:
# - the number of services to pick,
# - the name of a slot where to pick the services,
# - the name of a slot where to pick services if there is
#   not enough in the previous slot
# - and so on...
#
# "nearby_mode" is a boolean telling to find services close to each other
# instead of far from each other.
#
#### power user options, don't set them unless you know what you are doing!
# "mask" is a 64 bits hexadecimal mask used to check service distance.
# It defaults to FFFFFFFFFFFF0000. It can also be specified as "/48".
#
# "mask_max_shift" is the maximum number of bits to shift the mask
# to degrade it when distance requirement are not satisfiable.
# It defaults to 16.
